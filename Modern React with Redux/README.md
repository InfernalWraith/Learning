# Modern React with Redux - Code
These are all the apps created as part of the [*Modern React with Redux* Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) by Stephen Grider. 

There aren't all that many comments inside the code, so these projects are meant to be used as a quick refresher when it comes to some concepts. This means that these projects are best used in parallel with my notes for this course, found at [my CommandLists repo](https://github.com/InfernalWraith/Command-Lists/blob/master/React/React.md).
