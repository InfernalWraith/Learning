# Streams app variations
The **streams** app was made and then refactored several times:
- **streams_base** is the original base app without the RTMP server
- **streams** is the app with the RTMP server and appropriate modifications
- **streams_react-form** is an additional refactor which uses **react-form** (might be unfinished)
- **form-refactor** is the official downloadable code which contains the full refactor to **react-final-form**

**streams** covers the following sections:
Section 20: Navigation with React Router
Section 21: Handling Authentication with React
Section 22: Redux Dev Tools
Section 23: Handling Forms with Redux Form
Section 24: REST-Based React Apps
Section 25: Using React Portals
Section 26: Implementing Streaming Video
